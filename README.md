# 🧠🔍 NeuraMed - Intelligence that safeguards every pill

NeuraMed is an AI and Blockchain-powered platform designed to detect counterfeit medications and ensure pharmaceutical authenticity. This system enables patients, pharmacists, and healthcare providers to verify the legitimacy of medicine using AI-driven visual analysis and transparent blockchain tracking.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Counterfeit medicines pose a serious threat to global health. NeuraMed tackles this problem through:

- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence** that scans and analyzes images of pills and packaging to detect anomalies and forgeries.
- 🔗 **Blockchain technology** to trace the complete lifecycle of a medicine from the manufacturer to the consumer.
- 📱 **Instant QR/Barcode Scan** verification for real-time validation of medicine packages.

## 🌟 Features

- 📷 AI-powered medicine packaging image analysis
- 🔐 Blockchain traceability from factory to pharmacy
- 📦 QR code-based medicine verification
- 📊 Dashboard for doctors, pharmacists, and patients
- 🔄 Real-time verification and transaction logs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🖥️ Frontend
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework for production-ready UIs
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) *(Optional)* – For rapid UI styling

### ⚙️ Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – Backend runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) – API routing
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) – NoSQL database for storing user and medicine data

### 🤖 AI/ML Component

- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) / [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) – Layer 2 blockchain scaling

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Scan** – User scans the medicine packaging via the web/mobile interface. 📸
2. **Detect** – The AI model analyzes the image for inconsistencies in shape, color, label, or packaging. 🔍
3. **Verify** – Blockchain is queried to match product data against the official record. ✅
4. **Result** – The system shows whether the medicine is authentic or fake. 🏷️
